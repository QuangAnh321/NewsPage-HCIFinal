                        OnePlus packed its latest flagship phone, the OnePlus 7 Pro, with pretty much every trendy phone feature we've seen in the last year or so. And there's good reason for it. Phones nowadays are constantly one-upping each other with pop-up selfie cameras, in-display fingerprint sensors and multiple rear cameras. With the exception of, say, a foldable display, the OnePlus 7 Pro has enough features du jour to keep its fans enticed.
                        
                        But to remain relevant in this competitive industry, OnePlus needs to court users outside its loyal base. In the US, the phone works on Verizon and OnePlus' continued partnership with T-Mobile, which started only last year, helps. But it's the phone's $669 and Â£649 (6GB of RAM/128GB) starting price that is the deal maker. (There's also an 8GB/256GB variant that costs $699 and will be the one available from T-Mobile.)</p>
                <p class="contentBody">Since 2014, when the company launched its first OnePlus One, OnePlus has garnered a reputation for making phones with premium specs at a wallet-friendly price. And while every year it gets harder for OnePlus to keep prices low (compared to other brands, OnePlus has one of the highest increases in cost from model to model), the OnePlus 7 Pro is still a great value despite being the company's most expensive phone.</p>

                                        </a>
                                        <p>I spent August through November coaching everyone who asked not to buy a phone if they didn't have to. "Let's see what Apple/Google/One Plus brings," I said. "Wait for the deals," I added. But now the flagship phones for the year are fully reviews, and the Black Friday sales and other holiday promotions are starting in earnest. The perfect time to buy a new phone is now.</p>
